# 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure

## ✅ Overview

Brief summary of the secured and monitored infrastructure that hosts `www.foobar.com`.  
Explains secure communication (HTTPS), firewalls, and monitoring.

---

## 🖥️ Infrastructure Components

- Load Balancer (HAProxy with SSL termination)
- Web + App Server (Nginx + backend code)
- MySQL Database Server (Primary)
- 3 Firewalls (One per server)
- 1 SSL Certificate (HTTPS)
- 3 Monitoring Clients (e.g., Sumologic agent, Prometheus)

---

## 🔐 Security Components

### 🔸 Firewalls

- **3 Firewalls** deployed on:
  - Load Balancer
  - Web/Application Server
  - Database Server
- **Purpose**:
  - Block unwanted traffic
  - Filter by ports/IPs
  - Protect internal services

### 🔸 SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

- Deployed at the Load Balancer
- Ensures encrypted traffic
- Improves SEO and user trust

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### 🔹 Purpose of Monitoring

- Detect issues early (performance, errors)
- Analyze QPS (Queries Per Second)
- Prevent downtime

### 🔹 Tools Used

- Example: **Sumologic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus**
- Installed agents on each server

### 🔹 QPS Monitoring

- Use a monitoring agent that collects metrics
- For example: Prometheus + MySQL Exporter
- View data in a central dashboard
